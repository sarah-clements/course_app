# Course app API
## This REST API will add courses, create students, enroll students in courses, unenroll students in courses and retrieve a dictionary of students. I used the Express framework using Node to create this API since I'm most comfortable with Javascript and its lightweight. To run, follow the instructions below:

1. Download this repo.
2. Ensure you have node installed at https://nodejs.org/en/download/.
3. In the terminal type ```node index.js``` to run the file.
4. Use Postman to make GET and POST requests (ex: POST /courses?key=cs101&limit=2)
